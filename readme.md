## Clock and Time Zones

A clock made with <strong>JS</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
For the digital clock I worked with <em>momentjs</em>.

This was my third project, but the first one that was based on a tutorial. After I done the tutorial from <strong>[Wes Bos( 30 days of Javascript)](https://javascript30.com/)</strong> - <em>CSS +JS clock</em> and because the use of time in JS was daunting for me I decided that I had to give it a go.
In the middle of the project I learn about the library <em>momentjs</em> and also end up using it in the digital clock.

This project made me want to try different things in javascript and learn more about it and also about libraries.


In JS I worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Scopes</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>Time variables</li>
</ul>

In CSS I worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Positions</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
</ul>
