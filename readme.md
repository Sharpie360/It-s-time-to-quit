## Clock and Time Zones

A clock made with JS and CSS.
For the digital clock I worked with momentjs.

With JS I worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Scopes</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>Time variables</li>
</ul>

In CSS i worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Positions</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
</ul>
